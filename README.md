The A. T.e.a.m. (All Travellers Expetacions Are Meaningless)
______________________________________________
  In 2016, a programmer commando unit was sent to erasmus by the its for a job they didn't train to do. 
  These men promptly escaped from a maximum security contract to the Deep Web. 
  Today, still wanted by the government, they survive as coders of fortune. 
  If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire... the A. T.e.a.m.!
